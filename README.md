# SPSAM

Student project (course: __smart phone sensing__). Built together with Mike, a fellow CS student of mine. Added here for future reference :)

The project consists of three parts: Activity monitoring, Particle system localization and WIFI signal strength/fingerprinting localization.

### 1. Activity monitoring
Based purely on accelerometer data. Uses a fast fourier transform to retrieve the normalyzed frequency from the sensors x, y and z measurements.
This normalized frequency turned out to be good at differentiating between different activities such as walking, running, cycling and sitting/resting.

### 2. Particle system localization
Based on the paper ... 

### 3. WIFI signal strength/fingerprinting localization
Based on the paper ...
